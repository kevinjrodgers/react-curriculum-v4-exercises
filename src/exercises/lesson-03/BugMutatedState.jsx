/*
  BUG #2 — State Issue

  This component displays a count and updates it when the button is clicked.
  However, the way the count is being changed causes the component to behave
  incorrectly.
*/

import { useState } from 'react';
export default function BugMutatedState() {
  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleAdd() {
    //count++;
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Bug 2 Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add 1</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Explanation:
/* 
  The count is being altered outside of the state, which is not right, therefore the count needs to be altered using the setCount function
  in order to properly change the state.
